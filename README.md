# Data Structures and Algorithms

In this project I demonstrate my understanding of a variety of topics including:
* Arrays based sequences, particularly focused on special string test cases.
For example, given two strings find out if they are anagrams of each other.
* Stacks.
* Deque.
* Queues.
* Singularly linked lists.
* Doubly linked lists.
* Recursion.
* Trees, particularly binary trees.
* Hash tables.
* Searching and Sorting.
* Graph Algorithms.
